                        <p class="text-justify">Varanasi, or Benaras, (also known as Kashi) is one of the oldest living
                            cities in the world. Varanasi`s Prominence in Hindu mythology is virtually unrevealed. Mark
                            Twain, the English author and literature, who was enthralled by the legend and sanctity of
                            Benaras, once wrote : “Benaras is older than history, older than tradition, older even than
                            legend and looks twice as old as all of them put together. ”

                            The land of Varanasi (Kashi) has been the ultimate pilgrimage spot for Hindus for ages.
                            Hindus believe that one who is graced to die on the land of Varanasi would attain salvation
                            and freedom from the cycle of birth and re-birth. Abode of Lord Shiva and Parvati, the
                            origins of Varanasi are yet unknown. Ganges in Varanasi is believed to have the power to
                            wash away the sins of mortals.

                            Ganges is said to have its origins in the tresses of Lord Shiva and in Varanasi, it expands
                            to the mighty river that we know of. The city is a center of learning and civilization for
                            over 3000 years. With Sarnath, the place where Buddha preached his first sermon after
                            enlightenment, just 10 km away, Varanasi has been a symbol of Hindu renaissance. Knowledge,
                            philosophy, culture, devotion to Gods, Indian arts and crafts have all flourished here for
                            centuries. Also a pilgrimage place for Jains, Varanasi is believed to be the birthplace of
                            Parsvanath, the twenty-third Tirthankar.


                            <br> <br>
                            Vaishnavism and Shaivism have co-existed in Varanasi harmoniously. With a number of temples,
                            Mrs. Annie Besant chose Varanasi as the home for her ‘Theosophical Society’ and Pandit Madan
                            Mohan Malviya, to institute ‘Benares Hindu University, the biggest University in Asia.
                            Ayurveda is said to be originated at Varanasi and is believed to be the basis of modern
                            medical sciences such as Plastic surgery, Cataract and Calculus operations. Maharshi
                            Patanjali, the preceptor of Ayurveda and Yoga, was also affiliated with Varanasi, the holy
                            city. Varanasi is also famous for its trade and commerce, especially for the finest silks
                            and gold and silver brocades, since the early days.

                            Varanasi has also been a great center of learning for ages. Varanasi is associated with
                            promotion of spiritualism, mysticism, Sanskrit, yoga and Hindi language and honored authors
                            such as the ever-famous novelist Prem Chand and Tulsi Das, the famous saint-poet who wrote
                            Ram Charit Manas. Aptly called as the cultural capital of India, Varanasi has provided the
                            right platform for all cultural activities to flourish. Many exponents of dance and music
                            have come from Varanasi. Ravi Shankar, the internationally renowned Sitar maestro and Ustad
                            Bismillah Khan, (the famous Shehnai player) are all sons of the blessed city or have lived
                            here for major part of their lives.

                        <br>

                        <p>Varanasi grew as an important industrial centre famous for its muslin and <a href=""
                                style="color:red;">silk, fabrics,</a> <a href="" style="color:red;">perfumes,</a><a
                                href="" style="color:red;"> ivory works</a> and <a href=""
                                style="color:red;">sculpture</a>. Buddha is believed to have founded Buddhism here
                            around 528 BCE when he gave his first sermon, <a href="" style="color:red;">The Setting in
                                Motion of the Wheel of Dharma</a>, at nearby Sarnath. The city's religious importance
                            continued to grow in the 8th century, when Adi Shankara established the worship of Shiva as
                            an official sect of Varanasi. During the Muslim rule through the Middle Ages, the city
                            continued as an important centre of <a href="" style="color:red;">Hindu devotion</a>,
                            pilgrimage, mysticism and poetry which further contributed to its reputation as a centre of
                            cultural importance and religious education. Tulsidas wrote his epic poem on Rama's life
                            called <a href="" style="color:red;">Ram Charit Manas</a> in Varanasi. Several other major
                            figures of the Bhakti movement were born in Varanasi, including Kabir and Ravidas. Guru
                            Nanak visited Varanasi for Maha Shivaratri in 1507, a trip that played a large role in the
                            founding of <a href="" style="color:red;">Sikhism</a>.

                        <br>

                        <p>Traditional etymology links <a href="" style="color:red;">Varanasi</a> to the names of two
                            Ganges tributaries forming the city's borders: Varuna, still flowing in northern Varanasi,
                            and Assi, today a small stream in the southern part of the city, near Assi Ghat. The old
                            city is located on the north shores of the Ganges, bounded by Varuna and Assi.

                            In the Rigveda, an ancient Indian sacred collection of Vedic Sanskrit hymns, the city is
                            referred to as Kāśī (काशी: Kashi) from the Sanskrit verbal root kaś- <a href=""
                                style="color:red;">to shine</a>, making Varanasi known as <a href=""
                                style="color:red;">City of Light</a>, the <a href="" style="color:red;">luminous city as
                                an eminent seat of learning</a>. The name was also used by pilgrims dating from Buddha's
                            days.

                            Hindu religious texts use many epithets to refer to Varanasi, such as Kāśikā (काशिका:
                            Sanskrit: <a href="" style="color:red;">the shining one</a>), Avimukta (अविमुक्त: Sanskrit:
                            <a href="" style="color:red;">never forsaken</a> by Shiva), Ānandavana (आनंदवना: Sanskrit:
                            <a href="#" style="color:red;">the forest of bliss</a>), and Rudravāsa (रुद्रवासा: Sanskrit:
                            <a href="" style="color:red;">the place where Rudra/Śiva resides</a>)
